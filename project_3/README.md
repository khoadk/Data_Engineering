# Project: Data Warehouse

## Introduction:
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description:
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Project Datasets:
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data.
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

### Song Dataset:
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
- song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json.
- song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json.

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

## Schema for Song Play Analysis:
Using the song and event datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

**The primary benefit of a star schema is its simplicity for users to write, and databases to process: queries are written with simple inner joins between the facts and a small number of dimensions.**

### Fact Table
- **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent. Note: Upsert on level attribure.

### Dimension Tables
- **users** users in the app: user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level. Note: Upsert on level attribure.
- **songs** songs in music database: song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
- **artists** artists in music database: artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
- **time** timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units: start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Template:
- **create_table.py** is where you'll create your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
- **etl.py** is where you'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
- **sql_queries.py** is where you'll define you SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
- **working_files folder** all files/data in many working steps that are used to create final app.
    + first_look_dataset: preprocessed data like total files/objects and size of dataset in S3.
    + devops_iac: do configuration for redshift cluster.
    + working_etl: testing etl with single file before doing with many files in final app.
    
## Sample queries for DWH:
--Count users playing the song 'Drillbit'

SELECT count(user_id) FROM songs, songplays 
WHERE songs.title = 'Drillbit'
AND songs.song_id = songplays.song_id;

==> 0
